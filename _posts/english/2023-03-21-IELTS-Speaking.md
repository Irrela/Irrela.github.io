## Listing example
> What kinds of toys do children in China like to play with? 
Well, I think there are a lot of toys that are **prevalent** among young children, 

but I guess the most popular one should be Play-Doh(Point 1), kids are crazy about it cause they can sculpt it and mold it into anything they like, be it snowmen, bracelets, mini castles, etc. It’s a great chance for them to explore their creativity and imagination(REASON).

And also, it seems like Legos are quite popular(Point 2). To be honest, I have no idea why they like it, but I know they do, cause the hottest Lego kits are always sold out immediately, and if you ask kids around you what they want for birthday, there’s a really high possibility they’ll say Lego, at least for children around me.

So yeah, those are some of the toys kids like in China.(Paraphrase)

## Controversial example
Why is it difficult for some people to make decisions?
> Well, I suppose there are all sorts of reasons, but one that I can think of is maybe it has a bit to do with their upbringing, like maybe their parents were too controlling and hard to make every single decision for their children. 
> 
> Many articles and papers talk about how kids with parents like this grow up into indecisive adults. And I guess this happens quite often because when parents decide what you wear, what you eat, where you go, and who you meet, and they never allow you to make a decision for yourself, then gradually, you feel like there’s no point in deciding anything for yourself, and you get used to doing whatever your parents tell you to do, so you just lose the ability to think and choose as an individual. 
> 
> I know some people might say that where there is a will, there is a way, but bear in mind, what I’m saying is that the inability to make decisions is actually rooted in childhood experiences(Counter argument), and as a kid. we didn’t have much will power, did we?
> 
> Even if we did, with years and years of being controlled by a figure of authority, whatever will power we had would have been chipped away, piece by piece, until we are left with an inability to decide what we want or need(Reclaim).

## Money for young people & Society (12-3)
Why do some parents give their children money to spend each week?
> I think it's because kids need some money on them. They may need to take **public transportation** when they go out or buy a drink after playing with friends outside. Additionally, some parents **are consciously cultivating** their children's money concepts, teaching them to manage their wealth from a young age, which will help them in their future work and life.

Do you agree that schools should teach children how to manage money?

> I think it is very necessary. I have seen many peers whose financial situation is a mess after working, and **it is often unrelated to income level**. I have seen classmates with not very high income who, after **persisting in financial management** for a long time, can accumulate a considerable amount of wealth, while some friends with better income often need to borrow money from others. It can be seen that financial management is a very useful skill that everyone should master. Therefore, it is very necessary to teach children these knowledge in school.

Do you think it is a good idea for students to earn money while studying?
> **I think this needs to be discussed on a case-by-case basis**. Some students may not come from **well-off families** and **have no choice but to** work part-time to earn money, **while for other students**, I think it's important to **measure the benefits of working and studying**. If a student can obtain a **well-paying job** after graduation with professional skills and qualifications, I think it is more wise to **invest more time in studying school courses**. However, as you are aware, there are **exceptionally gifted** students who may have already established successful businesses **during their time in school**. Consequently, they have the option to **allocate more time and effort towards further developing their ventures**.

Do you think it is true that in today's society money cannot buy happiness?
> It's hard to say. I personally believe that money can indeed contribute a lot to one's overall well-being and happiness. If I were financially free, I would have more time to spend with my family, afford better education and healthcare for my families, and invest more in my personal hobbies, all of which would **positively impact** my happiness. **I think this holds true for most people**. However, **in extreme cases**, such as individuals who are already very wealthy, the amount of happiness that more wealth can bring may be limited.

What disadvantages are there in a society where the gap between rich and poor is very large?
> I think the biggest disadvantage is that it will **affect people's values and motivation**. When **there is a large wealth gap in society**, the rich can continue to accumulate wealth without doing anything, while **the poor can hardly change their situation no matter how hard they work**.So people tend to **maintain the status quo**, and the precious value of working hard and **getting corresponding rewards/payback** will be destroyed. For society, this leads to **stagnation** and lack of vitality. 

Do you think richer countries have a responsibility to help poorer countries?
> I don't think they have a responsibility or obligation to do so, but it is actually beneficial for them to do so. For example, if wealthy countries can help poor countries establish industries so that **more local people can have decent jobs**, then their income and **standard of living** can improve. They can gradually afford better products and services produced by richer countries, which can **in turn** benefit the wealthy countries.

## Watching films & movies (12-2)
What are the most popular types of films in your country?
> **Based on my impression**, action movies, **suspenseful mystery movies**, and comedies are quite popular. I see that on social media, these types of movies have a higher degree of popularity. However, in recent years, I have also seen some popular **sci-fi movies**, such as Nolan's Interstellar and China's own The Wandering Earth.


What is the difference between watching a film in the cinema and watching a film at home?
> I think the biggest difference is the **hardware equipment**. The screens in cinemas are huge and the sound quality is good, which can **give people a very shocking and immersive experience**, especially when watching some **big-budget war or action films**. I remember watching Dunkirk and 1917 in the cinema before, and the feeling was completely different from **when I later re-watched them** on TV at home. Of course, there are also advantages to watching at home, such as being able to watch the movies you want at any time, and popcorn and soft drinks are much cheaper than in the cinema.

Do you think cinemas will close in the future?
> **As I mentioned before**, due to the difference in hardware conditions, I think cinemas still **have a strong advantage in terms of** viewing experience in the short term. I know some people have **set up home theaters** that can achieve similar experiences, but I don't think this is **an affordable option for most people**. Additionally, I think watching movies **as a social activity** is also important to many people, such as **when couples go on dates**, watching a movie together would be a good choice after or before a dinner.

How important is the theatre in your country's history?
> **I want to confirm if you are referring to** theater where you watch plays and not movies theaters.
> 
> **I'm not very familiar with this area**, but I know that theater has a long history in my country. From emperors to ordinary people, everyone listened to plays, so theaters are very common and popular in ancient China. Theaters provide an important entertainment and social venue for people, and most traditional dramas are adapted from historical stories, so it also plays a big role in inheriting history and traditional culture.

# Own Expression
## Buy Time
I suppose there are many reasons

Do something in all kinds of ways

That’s sort of hard to answer, it’s a pretty controversial issue

That’s a tough question for me, **I’ve never thought about it before**

## Counter Argument
I know I can’t deny that …, but I just really think that **in most circumstances/cases**, it’s **the other way around**.
