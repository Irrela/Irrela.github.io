My stance leans towards the latter for several compelling reasons.

In the ongoing debate over preventing pollution, there are differing views on whether we should prioritize industrial development or to strike a balance between productivity and environment. My stance leans towards the latter for several compelling reasons.


In contemporary society, an increasing number of children are drawn to their smart devices for excessive time, I believe this phenomenon can be mainly attributed to the extensive and attractive contents that smartphones offer nowadays.

In the ongoing debate over whether this trend signifies a constructive or destructive development, my stance leans towards the latter for several compelling reasons.

First of all, unlimited playing cellphones poses a severe threat to children's health. It's commonly believed that prolonged screen time can have detrimental effects on human eyes. some researchers even directly point out that the overuse of smartphones among teenagers lead to them needing glasses at a younger age.

Moreover, smartphone addiction often consumes valuable time that could otherwise be devoted to studying and physical exercise. In our society, teenagers are expected to receive a solid fundamental education and build physical strength during this stage of life. However, we are more frequently witness a decline in both academic performance and physical health due to a lack of effort and time, which should be made a good use of but wasted in meaningless use of smartphones.

Finally, smartphones can expose to online safety issues. Most of the appealing applications on smartphones involve accessing the internet and online communication. Children who are not aware of these risks are prone to being cheated and having their privacy information stolen, and sometimes even having their personal security threatened. 

In conclusion, while there may be some conveniences that  smartphones can bring to children, a supervised and disciplined pattern of using these advanced devices appears necessary and beneficial for their well-rounded growth.
