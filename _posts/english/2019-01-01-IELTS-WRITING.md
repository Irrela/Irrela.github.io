# Small families
> In many countries today, people in cities either live alone or in small family units, rather than in large, extended family groups. Is this a positive or negative trend?

It is true that cities are seeing a rise in smaller families and one-person households, while the extended family ***is becoming a rarity***. ***In my opinion***, this is a negative development.

As families become smaller, the traditional family support network is disappearing, and this can ***have a negative impact on*** children as they grow up. In a nuclear family or single-parent household, childcare becomes an expensive and stressful part of daily life. Without the help of grandparents or aunts and uncles, busy parents must rely on ***babysitters***, nannies and after-school clubs to take care of younger children, while older children may be left alone after school and during holidays. The absence of adult family members ***can mean that*** friends, television and the Internet become ***the primary influences on children’s behaviour***. ***It is no surprise that*** the ***decline*** of the extended family has been linked to a rise in psychological and behavioural problems amongst young people.

***The trend towards people living alone*** is perhaps even more damaging because of the psychological effects of reduced human interaction. Individuals who live on their own have nobody to talk to in person, so they cannot share problems or discuss ***the highs and lows of daily life***. They **forgo** the constant stimulation and ***hustle and bustle*** of a large family, and are left to their own devices for extended periods of time. The lack of human contact in the home is necessarily replaced by passive distractions, such as television, video games, online chat rooms or Internet surfing. This type of existence is associated with ***boredom***, loneliness, and feelings of isolation or even ***alienation***, all of which are factors that are known to increase the risk of mental illness.

In conclusion, I believe that individuals ***thrive*** when they are part of larger family groups, ***and so it is worrying that*** many people are choosing to live alone or in such small family units.

# Three media
> Compare the advantages and disadvantages of three of the following as media for communicating information. State which you consider to be the most effective.  

• comics  • books  • radio  • television  • film  • theatre 

This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of three different media, namely books, radio and television. I will argue that television is the most powerful of these three media, in terms of its ability to communicate information. The main advantage of books is that they are usually considered to be reliable sources of information. People tend to refer to books when they want to research a subject in depth, and for this reason they continue to play an important role in education. On the other hand, books quickly go out of date, and therefore they are not the best medium for communicating news stories. Radio is a much more effective medium than books for the communication of up-to-date information. We can listen to news broadcasts about events as they happen, and a key benefit of radio is that we can listen to it while doing other activities, such as driving or working. The main drawback of radio, when compared to books or television, is that there is no visual element; we cannot see what the broadcaster is describing. In my opinion, television is the most dynamic of these three media because it brings us closer to reality than a book or radio programme ever can. For example, we can watch events as they take place on the other side of the world, or we can see the body language of a politician who is being interviewed. The disadvantages of television are that programmes tend to be short and interrupted by advertisements, meaning that information is presented in limited depth. In conclusion, while books and radio broadcasts are excellent communication tools, I believe the television can have an even greater impact on the viewer. (286 words, band 9) 

# Artificial intelligence
> Some people believe that nowadays we have too many choices. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

It is often said that modern life presents us with an overwhelming number of choices. I completely agree with this, and I believe that the Internet and globalisation are the two major factors involved.

It is undeniable that the Internet has led to a dramatic expansion in the number of choices that are available to us. The number of online media options, for instance, is now almost endless. There are countless websites offering entertainment, news, videos, on-demand TV and music streaming, many of which are free. I would argue that this abundance of media leads to confusion on the part of the average user, as we have to make so many decisions about the content that we consume. A personal example of this trend would be the fact that I had a choice of just four TV channels when I was a child, whereas I now have access to thousands of films and series through services like Netflix.

Alongside the influence of the Internet, globalisation is making the world smaller and compounding this problem of too much choice. Cheap international flights have made overseas travel possible for millions of people, but this also means that we are faced with a world of options when deciding where to go on holiday or even where to live. We no longer have the limited but simple travel choices of our grandparents’ generation. The same is true if we look at the increasing tendency for young people to study abroad. While the opportunity for overseas study seems appealing, many students are confused about where to go and which path to take.

In conclusion, we are faced with a huge number of options in most areas of life nowadays, and this is often more bewildering than beneficial.
