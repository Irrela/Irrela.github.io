Dear ???,


Dear Emily,
I haven't seen you for a long time so I am excited to meet you. I know that you are thinking of going on a camping holiday this summer for the first time. I'm very happy about that and I'm always ready to give you some advice.

Camping holiday is a wonderful idea. Especially in this summer. I think that not only do you want to go camping holiday in summer but also a lot of people because that is the best time for people to enjoy the life after had-worKing day. 

One of the most important reasons why you should go camping is that you are able to see the views and meet a lot of people. Tnat is a chance for you to understand more a lot of culture in our country which you have never known before. 

The other reason is that you can take part in some social activities which are very interesting. 

On the other hand, going camping in the summer has a lot of disadvantages. In the first place, it will have a negative impact on your skin so you have to wear hat before going camping outside. 

Secondly, it is easy for you to be ill because the weather in summer is quite hot so you have to prepare medicines in advance. 

I would also like to go camping with you this summer because my holiday in summer is very long so I hope that you can go on a camping holiday with me.

Hope to meet you soon.

Your close friend

### Task 2
You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.

Write about the following topic:

```
In many countries today, crime novels and TV crime dramas are becoming more and more popular.

Why do you think these books and TV shows are popular? 

What is your opinion of crime fiction and TV crime dramas?
```

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

Write at least 250 words.


====
This reason behind the rising popularity of  the crime novels and TV dramas, lies with the fact that the reality transmitted in the show/book, is our own. I'm from Rio de Janerio, a beautiful place with horrible people. and we know that soap operas show, is not our reality. Sometimes happly endings only happen in fairytales, which leads me to "Tropa de Elite" (Elite Squad, roughly translated) and why it was a phenonmenon.

The movie shows our dark side, the drug dealers with machine guns, the dangerous environment of the ***favelas*** and the corruption  in our police forces. It shows that there is nothing glamorous about being poor in Brazil(an idea that has been growing lately). And that? we relate. We know the truth, and we want it to be seen and heard, even if it is a fiction vision of it.

This is where the fictional vision part enters. When we watch the brave policeman or the brilliant CSI officers save the day, it gives a slight comfort. We feel like someone can save us from our reality, someone can be our hero and get the job done. It is a rather ***gullible*** thought, but it is the truth. BOPE‘s popularity (Rio de Janerio's elite police force) grew rapidly after the movie's success.

Want to feel heard and to be saved, and in a mix of reality and fantasy, these books and shows do that. I, for example, love them and even considered becoming a poice officer. But after careful consideration, I gave up the idea, for I think the world's salvation lies behind a pen or inside a book, and not the tip of a machine gun. But there is nothing wrong in daydreaming on our favorite shows.

## SPEAKING 
### P1
**Jewellery**
- How often do you wear jewellery? [Why/Why not?]

I wear a jade bracelet every day because it's supposed to bring me good luck. Every now and then I throw on a necklace if I feel my outfit is too boring. 

I think jewelry is a small accessory that makes you feel a little bit special, but I don't like to go crazy on it.


- What type of jewellery do you like best? [Why/Why not?]

Well it really depends on the occasion. In office I just wear small ***gemstone studs*** that look elegant; for parties I go for heavier jewellery such as gold or diamond necklaces. 

But my favorite jewellery items are watches. They are not really functional now that we have smartphones, but I think a good watch does make you look more professional and polished.

- When do people like to give jewellery in your country [Why?]

Birthdays, anniversaries, what else? I guess any major milestones in life can be celebrated with some jewellery. I think the question is really more about whom than when. 

Jewellery is a personal and intimate gift, so it's not considered appropriate to give to someone who's not a close friend.

- Have you ever given jewellery to someone as a gift? [Why/Why not?]

Yes. For my sister's birthday this year, I bought a red string for her to wear on the wrist. According to Chinese folk belief, it's a way to ward off evil spirits in her zodiac year. It's superstition, but better safe than sorry!
