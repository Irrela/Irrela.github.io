## New cycle path to Marshbrook Country Park
A new dual-purpose cycle and ***pedestrian*** route has been built from Atherton bus station to the country park's main entrance at Marshbrook. It avoids the main road into Atherton on the south side, and keeps mainly to less busy roads. Once the path leaves the built-up area, it goes through countryside until it reaches Marshbrook.

Funding for the cycle path has come largely from the county and town councils, while almost a third of it was raised through crowdfunding. Maintenance of the path is the responsibility of the county council. The cycle path was completed ahead of schedule - partly thanks to perfect weather for construction - and under budget.

Annie Newcome is the chief executive of Cycle Atherton, the organisation that aims to get people cycling more often and more safely. Cycle Atherton proposed the 12-kilometre-long cycle path initially, and has been active in promoting it.
Ms Newcome says she is delighted that all the hard work to achieve the funding proved successful.

Marshbrook Country Park is a very popular recreational area, and the new path makes it much easier to reach from the town in an environmentally friendly way. At 2.5 metres wide, it is also suitable for users of wheelchairs, mobility scooters and buggies, who have not previously had access to the park without using motor vehicles.

Although the path is now open, work is continuing to improve the signs along it, such as warnings when the path approaches a road. New hedges and trees will also be planted along stretches of the path, to provide some shelter from the wind and to benefit wildlife.

Further information and a detailed map of the path including a proposed 5-kilometre extension are available online. The map can easily be downloaded and printed. Visit the county council website and follow the links to Atherton Cycle Path.

## Study dramatic arts at Thornley

If you are hoping for a career in the theatre, Thornley College of Dramatic Arts is the place to come. For fifty years we have been providing top-quality courses for actors, directors, producers, musicians and everyone else who wishes to work professionally in the theatre or related industries. We also have expertise in preparing students for the specialised requirements of TV, film and radio. Well make sure you're thoroughly prepared for the reality of work in your chosen field.

Our college-based tutors all have extensive practical experience in the entertainment industry as well as academic qualifications, and we also collaborate with some of the country's best directors, writers and actors to create challenging, inspiring and exciting projects with our students.

We are well-known around the world, with our students coming from every continent. Every year, we receive two thousand applications for the one hundred places on our degree courses. Only the most talented get places, and we are proud that over ninety percent of our students gain professional work within a year of graduating 一 a figure few other drama colleges in the UK can match.

To mark our fiftieth anniversary this year, we are putting on a production of Theatre 500. Written by two staff members especially for this occasion, this multimedia show celebrates five hundred years of drama, and involves all our students in one way or another.

Another major development is that the college is about to move. Our new premises are now under construction in the heart of Thornley, next to the council building, which has won a prize for its architecture. For the last two years, we have been developing designs with Miller Furbank Architects for our new home, and one aim has been to ensure the buildings complement the council offices. Work started on the foundations of the buildings in March last year, and we plan to move to the new site this coming September.

We have also been talking to cultural organisations in the district, and considering how we can bring cost-free benefits to the local community, as well as to our students. As a result, part of the space in the new buildings has been designed to be adaptable, in order to accommodate classes, performances and workshops for different-sized groups of local people.

## How to make your working day more enjoyable

Research shows that work takes up approximately a third of our lives. Most of us get so bogged down with day-to-day tasks though, that we easily forget why we originally applied for the job and what we can get out of it. Here are a few ideas for how to make your working day better.

Physical changes to your work environment can make a massive difference to how you feel. Get some green plants or a family photo for your desk. File all those odd bits of paper or throw them away. All of these little touches can make your work environment feel like ifs yours. Make sure any screens you have are at a suitable height so you're not straining your neck and shoulders.

Humans need a change of environment every now and then to improve productivity. Go out at lunchtime for a quick walk. If you have the option, ifs a good idea to work from
home occasionally. And if there's a conference coming up, ask if you can go along to it. Not only will you practise your networking skills, but you'il also have a day away from
the office.

Use coffee time to get to know a colleague you don't usually speak to. There's no point in getting away from staring at one thing though, only to replace it with another; so leave your mobile alone! Another tip is to try and stay out of office gossip. In the long run it could get you in more trouble than you realise.

When youYe trying to focus on something, hunger is the worst thing. If you can, keep some healthy snacks in your desk because if you have something you can nibble on, it will make you work more effectively and you'll enjoy it more. Also, if you're dehydrated, you won't be able to focus properly. So keep drinking water.

Finally, if you've been dreaming about starting up a big project for some time, do it! There are so many different things you can do to get you enjoying work more each day.

## How to get promoted

If you're sitting at your desk wondering whether this will be the year you finally get promoted, here are some tips.

It starts with you. You are perhaps the most important part in the 'promotion process5, so you need to know what you want 一 and why you want it. Take an honest look at yourself 一 your achievements and also your skills, particularly those you could exploit to take on a different role.

Your boss is the gatekeeper. If you think your boss is likely to be on your side, ask for a meeting to discuss your serious commitment to the organisation and how this could translate into a more defined career plan. If you are less sure about your boss's view of your prospects and how they may react, start softly with a more deliberate focus on increasing your boss's understanding of the work you do and the added value you deliver.

Think about how you are perceived at work. In order for you to get your promotion, who needs to know about you? Who would be on the interview panel and whose opinion and input would they seek? And once you've got a list of people to impress, ask yourself - do they know enough about you? And I mean really know - what you do day to day at your desk, your contribution to the team, and perhaps most importantly, your potential.

The chances are that those decision-makers won't know all they should about you. Raising your profile in your organisation is critical so that when those in charge start looking at that empty office and considering how best to fill it, the first name that pops into their heads is yours. If your firm has a newsletter, volunteer to write a feature to include in it. If they arrange regular client events, get involved in the organisation of them. And so on.

If you think your experience needs enhancing, then look at ways you can continue to improve it. If you are confident in your professional expertise but lack the latest management theory, enrol on some relevant courses that fit around your day job.

So what are you waiting for?

## Animals can tell right from wrong
Until recently, humans were thought to be the only species to experience complex emotions and have a sense of morality. But Professor Marc Bekoff, an ecologist at University of Colorado, Boulder, US, believes that morals are "hard­ wired5 into the brains of all mammals and provide the social glue5 that allows animals to live together in groups.

His conclusions will assist animal welfare groups pushing to have animals treated more humanely; Professor Bekoff who presents his case in his book WildJustice, said: Just as in humans, the moral nuances of a particular culture or group will be different from another, but they are certainly there. Moral codes are species specific, so they can be difficult to compare with each other or with humans.5 Professor Bekoff believes morals developed in animals to help regulate behaviour in social groups. He claims that these help to limit fighting within the group and encourage co-operative behaviour.

His ideas have met with some controversy in the scientific community. Professor Frans de
who examines the behaviour of primates, including chimpanzees, at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, US, said: ‘I don't believe animals are moral in the sense we humans are- with a well-developed and reasoned sense of right and wrong 一 rather that human morality incorporates a set of psychological tendencies and capacities such as empathy, reciprocity, a desire for co-operation and harmony that are older than our species. Human morality was not formed from scratch, but grew out of our primate psychology. Primate psychology has ancient roots, and I agree that other animals show many of the same tendencies and have an intense sociality.

Wolves live in tight-knit social groups that are regulated by strict rules. Wolves also demonstrate fairness. During play, dominant wolves will appear to exchange roles with lower-ranking wolves. They pretend to be submissive and go so far as to allow biting by the lower-ranking wolves, provided it is not too hard. Prof Bekoff argues that without a moral code governing their actions, this kind of behaviour would not be possible. Astonishingly, if an animal becomes aggressive, it will perform a play bow' to ask forgiveness before play resumes.

In other members of the dog family, play is controlled in a similar way. Among coyotes,
cubs which are too aggressive are ignored by the rest of the group and often end up having to leave entirely. Experiments with domestic dogs, where one animal was given some 'sweets' and another wasn't, have shown that they possess a sense of fairness as they allowed their companion to eat some.

Elephants are intensely sociable and emotional animals. Research by Iain Douglas-Hamilton, from the department of zoology at Oxford University, suggests elephants experience compassion and has found evidence of elephants helping injured members of their herd. In
2003, a herd of 11 elephants rescued antelopes which were being held inside an enclosure in KAvaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The top female elephant unfastened all of the metal latches holding the gates closed and swung them open, allowing the antelopes to escape. This is thought to be a rare example of animals showing empathy for members of another species 一 a trait previously thought to be the exclusive preserve of humankind.

A laboratory experiment involved training Diana monkeys to insert a token into a slot to obtain food. A male who had become skilled at the task was found to be helping the oldest female, who had not learned how to do it. On three occasions the male monkey picked up tokens she dropped and inserted them into the slot and allowed her to have the food. As there was no benefit for the male monkey, Professor BekofF argues that this
is a clear example of an animals actions being driven by some internal moral compass.

Since chimpanzees are known to be among the most cognitively advanced of the great apes and our closest cousins, it is perhaps not remarkable that scientists should suggest they live by moral codes. A chimpanzee known as Knuckles is the only known captive chimpanzee to suffer from cerebral palsy, which leaves him physically and mentally impaired. What is extraordinary is that scientists have observed other chimpanzees interacting with him differently and he is rarely subjected to intimidating displays of aggression from older males. Chimpanzees also demonstrate a sense of justice and those who deviate from the code of conduct of a group are set upon by other members as punishment.

Experiments with rats have shown that they will not take food if they know their actions will cause pain to another rat. In lab tests, rats were given food which then caused a second group of rats to receive an electric shock. The rats with the food stopped eating rather than see this happen.

Whales have been found to have spindle cells in their brains. These specialised cells were thought to be restricted to humans and great apes, and appear to play a role in empathy
and understanding the emotions of others. Humpback whales, fin whales, killer whales and sperm whales have all been found to have spindle cells. They also have three times as many spindle cells as humans and are thought to be older in evolutionary terms. This finding suggests that emotional judgements such as empathy may have evolved considerably earlier in history than formerly thought and could be widespread in the animal kingdom.

## Young Fashion Designer UK competition
Young Fashion Designer UK is an exciting national competition which aims to showcase and promote the exceptional work achieved by students studying courses in textile design, product design and fashion throughout the UK.

The competition is designed for students to enter the coursework they are currently working on rather than specifically producing different pieces of work. If you would like to add to your coursework, that is for you and your teacher to decide.

You can apply independently or through your school/college. To enter please ensure you follow these steps:

1) Provide three A3 colour copies from your design folder. You must include:
- initial ideas about the clothing
- a close-up photograph of the front and back view of the finished clothing.
  
2) Please label each sheet clearly with your name and school (on the back).

3) Print off a copy of your registration form and attach it to your work.

4) Post your entry to the Young Fashion Designer Centre.

Once the entry deadline has passed, the judges will select the shortlist of students who will be invited to the Finals. You will be notified if you are shortlisted. You will need to bring originals of the work that you entered. Each finalist will have their own stand consisting of a table and tabletop cardboard display panels. Feel free
to add as much creativity to your stand as possible. Some students bring tablets/ laptops with slideshows or further images of work but it should be emphasised that these may not necessarily improve your chances of success.

The judges will assess your work and will ask various questions about it. They will look through any supporting information and the work you have on display before coming together as a judging panel to decide on the winners. You are welcome to ask the judges questions. In fact, you should make the most of having experts on hand!

There are 1st, 2nd and 3rd prize winners for each category. The judges can also
decide to award special prizes if the work merits this. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd place
winners will receive a glass trophy and prize from a kind donor.

## Which keyboard should you buy?
> It's worth remembering that a bad keyboard can significantly affect your entire computing experience. So make sure you pick the right keyboard for your needs.

A Logitech K120

Logitech's K120 offers a number of extra features. It's spill-resistant, draining small amounts of liquid if you have an accident. It isn't particularly eye-catching, but it feels very solid. For the price, it's a tempting choice.

Cherry MX 3.0 Keyboard

The Cherry MX 3.0 looks simple and neat, thanks to its compact build. It's solid, durable and you don't need to push keys all the way down to activate them. Its also rather loud though, which can take some getting used to.

Logitech K780

The K780 is a compact, pleasantly modern-looking keyboard. There's an integrated stand for smartphones and tablets too. It's quiet to type onz and the circular keys are easy to familiarise yourself with, well-spaced and large enough to hit accurately. For this price though, the lack of backlighting is disappointing.

Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic

The Sculpts curved, strange-looking build serves a purpose. It provides wrist support and lifts your forearms into a relaxed position so you don't hurt yourself from typing for lengthy periods. It feels weird, but it seems to do the trick.

Microsoft Universal Bluetooth Keyboard

Microsoft's Bluetooth keyboard has one very handy feature 一 you can fold it in
half and carry it around in your jacket pocket or bag, and it feels rather like a large wallet. It has generously sized keys, though the two-piece spacebar takes some getting used to. Another useful feature is that you can get up to three months' use from a single charge.

Corsair Strafe RGB Keyboard

Corsair's keyboard is expensive, flashy and extremely impressive. All of its keys are programmable, there's eye-catching backlighting and the buttons are textured for improved grip. All this is because it's designed for gamers. However, it's also silent, meaning it is suitable for everyday office work too.

## Working for a small company may be better than you think

Recent research shows that many job-seekers believe their ideal position would be in a large company. However, working for a small or medium-sized business has many advantages that are too easily overlooked. Here are just a few of them.

Working in a small organisation with a small workforce means it's likely to be easy
to become part of it. It won't be long before you're familiar with the staff and the departments that you need to deal with. This can provide a feeling of comfort that takes much longer to develop in a large company. Departments are likely to be small and have close connections with each other, which helps to make internal communication work well 一 everyone knows what's going on. You'll also gain a better understanding of how your own role fits into the company as a whole.

In a small business you're likely to have considerable variety in your workload, including opportunities to work in different areas of the company, which will allow you to identify abilities that you didn't know you had. An introduction to new activities could even lead to a change of career. This variety in your work will help to make it stimulating, so you have a good reason for getting out of bed in the morning.

There will be plenty of opportunities to show initiative, and you'll also learn to function well as part of a team. Because ifs much harder to overlook someone within a small workforce than a large one, your efforts are more likely to attract the attention of those higher up. You'll have plenty of opportunity to show what you can do, and to have your potential noticed. The result is very likely to be that promotion comes to you faster.

Small businesses are usually flexible, something that is rarely true of large organisations. This means that if theyYe well managed, they can adapt to make the most of changes in the wider economy, which in turn can help you. Don't dismiss them as a place to work because of the myths about them. Small firms can be ideal places for developing your career.

## Starting a new job
A

Make sure you know when and where you are expected to report on your first day. If the route from home is unfamiliar to you, make a practice run first: the normal first activity in a new job is a meeting with your boss, and it would be embarrassing to be late. Dress formally until you're sure of the dress code.

B 

You should expect to have an induction programme planned for you: a security pass; visits 
to whatever parts of the organisation you need to understand to do your job properly; meetings with anyone who could affect your success in the role; and someone to show you where everything is and tell you all the real rules of
the culture 一 the ones that are never written down but which everyone is meant to follow.

C 

It can be a shock to join a new organisation. When you are a newcomer, feeling uncertain and perhaps a little confused, there can be a strong temptation to
talk about your old job and organisation as a way of reminding yourself and telling others that you really know what you are doing, because you did it in your previous role. Unfortunately, this will suggest that you have a high opinion of yourself, and that you think your old place was better. It has enormous power to annoy, so don't do it.

D 

All employers have a core product or service paid for by customers which justifies their existence. If you are not part of this core activity, remember that your role
is to provide a service to the people who are part of it. Understanding their concerns and passions is essential for understanding why your own role exists, and for knowing how to work alongside these colleagues. This is why you must see this product or service in action.

E 

When I worked for a television company, all of us, whatever our job, were strongly encouraged to visit a studio and see how programmes were made. This was
wise. Make sure you do the equivalent for whatever is the core activity of your new employer.

F 

Don't try to do the job too soon. This may seem strange because, after all, you have been appointed to get on and do the job. But in your first few weeks your task is to learn what the job really is, rather than immediately starting to do what you assume it is.

G 

Starting a new job is one of life's major transitions. Treat it with the attention it deserves and you will find that all your work in preparing and then going through the selection process has paid off magnificently.

## How animals keep fit
No one would dream of running a marathon without first making a serious effort to train for it. But no matter how well they have stuck to their training regime, contestants will find that running non-stop for 42 kilometres is going to hurt.

Now consider the barnacle goose. Every year this bird carries out a 3000-kilometre migration. So how do the birds prepare for this? Do they spend months gradually building up fitness? That's not really the barnacle gooses style. Instead, says environmental physiologist Lewis Halsey, "They just basically sit on the water and eat a lot?

Until recently, nobody had really asked whether exercise is as tightly connected to fitness in the rest of the animal kingdom as it is for us. The question is tied up in a broader assumption: that animals maintain fitness because of the exercise they get finding food and escaping predators.

Halsey points out that this may not necessarily be the case. Take the house cat. Most domestic cats spend much of the day lounging around, apparently doing nothing, rather than hunting for food. But over short distances, even the laziest can move incredibly fast when they want to. Similarly, black and brown bears manage to come out of several months5 hibernation with their muscle mass intact 一without having to lift so much as a paw during this time.

Barnacle geese go one better. In the process of sitting around, they don't just maintain their fitness. They also develop stronger hearts and bigger flight muscles, enabling them to fly for thousands of kilometres in a migration that may last as little as two days.

So, if exercise isn't necessarily the key to physical strength, then what is? One clue comes from a broader view of the meaning of physical fitness. Biologically speaking, all it means is that the body has undergone changes that make it stronger and more efficient. In animals such as bears these changes appear to be triggered by cues such as falling temperatures or insufficient food. In the months of hibernation, these factors seem to prompt the release of muscle-protecting compounds which are then carried to the bears' muscles in their blood and prevent muscle loss.

Barnacle geese, Halsey suggests, may be responding to an environmental change such as temperature, which helps their bodies somehow 'know' that a big physical challenge is looming. In other bird species, that cue may be something different. Chris Guglielmo, a physiological ecologist, has studied the effect of subjecting migratory songbirds known
as yellow-rumped warblers to changing hours of daylight. 'We don't need to take little songbirds and train them up to do a 6- or 10-hour flight/ he says. If they are subjected to the right daylight cycle, we can take them out of the cage and put them in the wind tunnel, and they fly for 10 hours.

Unlike migratory birds, however, humans have no biological shortcut to getting fit. Instead, pressures in our evolutionary history made our bodies tie fitness to exercise.

Our ancestors, lives were unpredictable. They had to do a lot of running to catch food and escape danger, but they also needed to keep muscle mass to a minimum because muscle is biologically expensive. Each kilogram contributes about 10 to 15 kilocalories a day to our metabolism when resting - which doesnt sound like much until you realise that muscles account for about 40 percent of the average persons body mass. "Most of us are spending 20 percent of our basic energy budget taking care of muscle mass/ says Daniel Lieberman, an evolutionary biologist and marathon runner.

So our physiology evolved to let our weight and fitness fluctuate depending on how much food was available. 'This makes us evolutionarily different from most other animals/ says Lieberman. In general, animals merely need to be capable of short bouts of intense activity, whether its the cheetah chasing prey or the gazelle escaping. Cats are fast, but they dont need to run very far. Perhaps a few mad dashes around the house are all it takes to keep a domestic one fit enough for feline purposes. "Humans, on the other hand, needed to adapt to run slower, but for longer/ says Lieberman.

He argues that long ago on the African savannah, natural selection made us into "supremely adapted' endurance athletes, capable of running prey into the ground and ranging over long distances with unusual efficiency. But only, it appears, if we train. Otherwise we quickly degenerate into couch potatoes.

As for speed, even those animals that do cover impressive distances dont have to be the fastest they can possibly be. Barnacle geese neednt set world records when crossing the North Atlantic; they just need to be able to get to their destination. And,' says exercise physiologist Ross Tucker, "humans may be the only animal that actually cares about reaching peak performance? Other than racehorses and greyhounds, both ofwhich we have bred to race, animals arent directly competing against one another. ‘I dont know that all animals are the same, performance-wise ... and we dont know whether training would enhance their ability,5 he says.

## Workplace health and safety considerations for plumbers

Like many trades, plumbing can be a dangerous job. It is important to take all reasonably practicable measures to keep customers and yourself incident and injury free.

Biohazard waste

Plumbers regularly come into contact with biohazard waste. It's the nature of the job, but that doesn't mean you should be complacent about it. According to Safe Work Australia, communicable diseases from work-related exposures to biological hazards such as sewage have been estimated to cause 320,000 deaths across the globe each year. In addition to this, plumbers are regularly exposed to other biohazards such as mould, bacteria and algae. Don't risk it 一 make sure appropriate protective clothing and equipment is used.

Confined spaces

Plumbers may spend much of their time working in confined spaces, where they are at risk from contaminants, including airborne gases, vapours and dusts, that may cause injury from fire or explosion. They may also be exposed to high concentrations of airborne contaminants that may be harmful to health. For example, one plumber was fined $220,000 after an employee suffered from carbon-monoxide poisoning. Another potential hazard for plumbers in confined spaces is that of drowning, if water sources are not adequately cut off.
The Safe Work Australia confined spaces code of practice outlines the necessary steps and precautions for avoiding illness and injury.

Electricity

The Master Plumbers, Association calls electricity 'plumbing's hidden killer'. Metal
pipes are often conductive and so gloves which provide insulation should form part of a plumber's tool kit, as should a plumbing voltage monitor and a volt tester. Gloves should be checked prior to every use and replaced every 12 to 14 months. Electrical equipment like bridging conductors should be regularly checked, with appropriate tags on the equipment to verify its safety. The project should be stopped immediately if there is any sign of electricity, so that the power can be disconnected by a qualified electrician prior to continuing work.

## How to manage flexible working with your employees

THere is no denying that flexible working has grown enormously in recent years. It does, however, require careful management.

When it comes to implementing flexible working one word is key: trust. All flexible workers should be trusted and given well-defined objectives from the start and their contribution should be assessed according to their output, as opposed to the time they spend on the
job. It can be a big step to implement such a change in your business, so if you are slightly cautious then I recommend perhaps setting up an end-of-the-day review to see how much progress has been made. As all parties find their feet with the new set-up, this contact can slowly be reduced.

In my eyes, it is also vital that there is shared calendar access for everyone so that people can see where their colleagues are each day. This way if they need to catch up with someone they can plan when to do so. Technology now exists to enable employees to stay in touch with other members of staff and external partners. iMeet, for example, is a tool which allows all forms of collaboration for remote working, from video conferencing, live chat and file sharing to screen sharing. The new breed of worker is therefore fully equipped to work productively away from the office, and can still feel like they re in the same room as others when necessary.

In my experience, employees are often more productive working at home as they can
work the exact hours they want and do not have to cope with distraction caused by other employees. Being outside the confines of the office walls also appears to foster creativity. In addition, we find stafF are more motivated as they have a better work—life balance. In terms of the business, we find this helps with top talent recruitment and staff retention, and a happy workforce is a more successful one.

## Preventing the theft of turtle eggs
> Conservationists and law enforcement have struggled to prevent wildlife trafficking. But could some plastic eggs and GPS trackers change the game? '

A 

Humans have been eating sea turtle eggs (and killing adult turtles for meat) for millennia. However, as human populations exploded and as sea turtles began
to confront additional threats such as intensive fishing, beach development and climate change, sea turtle populations declined precipitously. Today, all but one of the world's seven species of sea turtles are considered threatened according to the IUCN* Red List. And the one thafs not 一 the flatback turtle - is listed as data deficient, which means scientists simply don't know how ifs doing.

B 

One major problem is that every year millions of sea turtle eggs are illegally taken by poachers for sale on the black market. The situation is particularly serious in Nicaragua, in Central America, which is home to four sea turtle species.

Kim Williams-Guillen, who works for conservation body Paso Pacifico, described the poaching of sea turtle nests on the beaches of Nicaragua as 'uncontrolled, unregulated, extensive and contested5. Even the best-protected beaches are plundered to some extent and it's not uncommon to see poachers digging up nests just meters from tourists watching sea turtles laying their clutch at night, she said. This poaching becomes particularly frenzied during the arribadas - mass laying events where thousands of turtles nest on the same beach for a single night in a biological strategy to overwhelm natural predators.

C 

'Even with armed guards, the numbers of poachers overwhelm military personnel by ten or twenty to one/ Williams-Guillen said. 'Although many poachers are locals with limited resources, during these arribadas there are influxes of gangs of poachers from larger cities outside local communities. These are not just local poor people without other options.

But to protect the country's sea turtles, Williams-Guillen said conservationists shouldn't just depend on catching low-level operators. 'If one poacher decides to stop, another one will just step into his place ...we need to know more about the middlemen and people higher up in the distribution chain/ she said.

D 

Paso Pacifico's solution is the creation of high-tech sea turtle eggs: fake eggs convincingly crafted to look like the real thing, but which contain GPS tracking devices. These have the potential to reveal the destination markets for trafficked sea turtle eggs.

Making convincing sea turtle eggs is not easy, and Paso Pacifico is still working on perfecting a prototype. In particular, it's proving quite problematic to create the right texture, since sea turtle eggs are not covered in a hard shell like those of birds, but are quite flexible.

So Paso Pacifico brought in Lauren Wilde, a special effects artist in the US, to create a convincing outer shell. First, Wilde had to get her hands on the real thing. Since ifs illegal to send sea turtle eggs over the border, Wilde is using land turtle eggs from California. 'It was really eye opening and important for me to feel these eggs and how the shell bends a little/ she said.

To get the GPS device inside the shell, Paso Pacifico is using 3D printers to make a plastic ball which will then have a GPS transmitter fitted inside. This will take
the place of the embryo inside the shell. Lastly the fake shells will be sealed with silicone, waterproofing them.

E 

Sea turtles on average lay around 100 eggs in a nest, and once the fake eggs are finished they will be slipped in with the real ones. Williams-Guillen said it might even be possible to deliver fake eggs into nests while poachers are at work. Wary of tourists, poachers will often back off if strangers come near and then return when they have gone. It would be pretty easy to drop an egg in the dark into a nest they have been digging up,' she said.

Once the poacher picks up the fake egg along with the real ones, conservationists and law enforcement agents will be able to track them. Experts believe most of the stolen eggs eventually make their way out of Nicaragua, possibly to El Salvador
or Guatemala. However, there is also growing concern that sea turtle eggs from Central America are actually heading to the USA, from where they are sold on to other countries around the world.

F 

To date, Paso Pacifico has yet to put a single fake egg in a nest. But Williams- Guillen said she isnJt too concerned that publicity for their scheme will result in poachers looking for the eggs. The vast majority of the poaching is happening at night, so already it is hard to tell [the eggs] apart, and at this point, poachers and middlemen are not closely inspecting eggs, but rather shoving them into a sack as quickly as possible.5

Of course, poachers will eventually become aware of the prospect of fake eggs among the real ones 一 especially when customers try to bite into an egg and break their teeth on the GPS transmitter instead. So, Paso Pacifico plans to do a massive deployment of as many fakes as possible to gather a lot of data before poachers get wise.

Knowing where the eggs go will allow conservationists and law enforcement agents to focus their resources on the right places 一 whether it be through awareness­ building campaigns or crackdowns on illegal sellers. And eventually Paso Pacifico hopes to share the technology with interested parties around the world.

## Rice cookers
> What's the best rice cooker for you?

Ezy Rice Cooker

This has a 1.8 litre pot and a ***stainless*** steel exterior. It has a separate glass ***lid***, and the ***handle*** on the lid stays cool. It produces perfectly cooked white rice, but tends to ***spit*** when cooking ***brown rice***. There are slight dirt traps around the rim of the lid, and neither the pot nor the lid is dishwasher safe.

Family Rice Cooker

This has a plastic exterior and a ***flip-top*** lid. The lid locks when closed and becomes a secure handle to carry the cooker. The aluminium interior pot is quite difficult to clean, and it can't be put in a dishwasher. Its programmed to adjust the temperature once the rice is done so that it stops cooking but doesn't get cold.

Mini Rice Cooker

This has a flip-top lid and a 0.3 litre capacity. The interior pot is made of ***non-stick*** aluminium and is dishwasher safe. This rice cooker is ideal when cooking for one. However it does not have any handles at the side, and water sometimes overflows when cooking brown rice.

VPN Rice Cooker

This has a painted steel exterior with a handle on each side and a steel inner pot. It has a ***lift-off*** lid and comes with a ***booklet*** including a range of ideas for rice dishes. However, the keep-warm setting must be manually selected and the handles are tricky to grip.

S16 Rice cooker

This is simple to use, not spitting or boiling over even when cooking brown
rice. The exterior stays cool when in use, so there's no danger of ***burning your hand***. However, the lack of handles is a ***nuisance***, and a recipe book would have been useful.

## Safety when working on roofs
A fall from height is the most serious ***hazard*** associated with roof work. Preventing falls from roofs is a priority for WorkSafe New Zealand. Investigations by WorkSafe into falls that occur while working at height show that more than 50 percent of falls are from under three metres, and most of these are from ***ladders*** and roofs. The cost of these falls is estimated to be $24 million a year 一 to say nothing of the human costs that result from these falls. More injuries happen on ***residential building sites*** than any other workplace in the construction sector.

In order to prevent such injuries, a hazard assessment should be carried out for all work on roofs to assess potential dangers. It is essential that the hazards are identified before the work starts, and that the necessary equipment, appropriate ***precautions***
and systems of work are provided and implemented. Hazard identification should be repeated periodically or when ***there is a change in conditions***, for example, the weather or numbers of staff ***onsite***.

The first thing to be considered is whether it is possible to eliminate this hazard completely, so that workers are not exposed to the danger of falling. This can sometimes be done at the design, construction planning, and ***tendering stage***. If the possibility of
a fall cannot be eliminated, some form of ***edge protection*** should be used to prevent workers from falling. It may be possible to use the existing ***scaffolding*** as edge protection. If this is not practicable, then temporary work platforms should be used. In cases where such protection is not possible, then steps should be taken to minimise the likelihood of any ***harm resulting***. This means considering the use of safety nets and other similar systems to make it less likely that injury will be caused if a fall does occur.

Ladders should only be employed for short-duration maintenance work such as ***touching up paint***. People using ladders should be trained and instructed in the selection and safe use of ladders. There should be ***inspection*** of all ladders on a regular basis to ensure they are safe to use.

## Maternity Allowance for working women
You can claim Maternity Allowance once you've been pregnant for 26 weeks. Payments start 11 weeks before the date on which your baby is due.

The amount you can get depends on your eligibility. You could get either:

- £140.98 a week or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is less) for 39 weeks
- £27 a week for 14 weeks

Maternity Allowance for 39 weeks
You might get Maternity Allowance for 39 weeks if one of the following applies:
- you're employed
- you're self-employed and pay Class 2 National Insurance (including voluntary National Insurance)
- you've recently stopped working

You may still qualify even if youve recently stopped working. It doesnt matter if you had different jobs, or periods when you were unemployed.

Maternity Allowance for 14 weeks
You might get Maternity Allowance for 14 weeks if for at least 26 weeks in the 66 weeks before your baby is due:

- you were married or in a civil partnership
- you were not employed or self-employed
- you took part in the business of your self-employed spouse or civil partner

How to claim
You'll need an MAI claim form, available online. You can print this and fill it in, or fill it in online. You also need to provide a payslip or a Certificate of Small Earnings Exemption as proof of your income, and proof of the baby's due date, such as a doctors letter.

You should get a decision on your claim within 24 working days.
You should report any changes to your circumstances, for example, if you go back to work, to your local Jobcentre Plus as they can affect how much allowance you get.

## The California Gold Rush of 1849
> The discovery of gold in the Sacramento Valley sparked the Gold Rush, arguably one of the most significant events to shape American history in the 19th century

`A` On January 24, 1848, James Wilson Marshall, a carpenter, found small flakes of gold in the American River near Coloma, California. At the time, Marshall was working to build a water-powered sawmill for businessman John Sutter. As it happens, just days after Marshall's discovery, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed, ending the Mexican-American War and transferring California, with its mineral deposits, into the ownership of the United States. At the time, the population of the territory consisted of 6,500 Californios (people of Spanish or Mexican descent); 700 foreigners (primarily Americans); and 150,000 Native Americans.

`B` Though Marshall and Sutter tried to keep news of the discovery quiet, word got out, and by mid-March 1848 at least one newspaper was reporting that large quantities of gold were being found. Though the initial reaction in San Francisco was disbelief, storekeeper Sam Brannan set off a frenzy when he paraded through town displaying a small bottle containing gold from Sutter's Creek. By mid-June, some three-quarters of the male population of San Francisco had left town for the gold mines, and the number of miners in the area reached 4,000 by August.

`C` As news spread of the fortunes being made in California, the first migrants to arrive were those from lands accessible by boat, such as Oregon, the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii), Mexico, Chile, Peru and even China. Only later would
the news reach the East Coast, where press reports were initially skeptical. Throughout 1849, thousands of people around the United States (mostly men) borrowed money, mortgaged their property or spent their life savings to make the arduous journey to California. In pursuit of the kind of wealth they had never dreamed of, they left their families and local areas; in turn, their wives had no option but to shoulder different responsibilities such as running farms or businesses, and many made a real success of them.

By the end of the year, the non-native population of California was estimated at 100,000 (as compared with 20,000 at the end of 1848 and around 800 in March 1848). To accommodate the needs of the '49ers, as the gold miners were known, towns had sprung up all over the region, complete with shops and other businesses seeking to make their own Gold Rush fortune. The overcrowded chaos of the mining camps and towns grew ever more lawless. San Francisco, for its part, developed a bustling economy and became the central metropolis of the new frontier.

`D` How did all these would-be miners search for gold? Panning was the oldest way. The basic procedure was to place some gold-bearing materials, such as river gravel, into a shallow pan, add some water, and then carefully swirl the mixture around so the water and light material spilled over the side. If all went well, the heavier gold nuggets or gold dust would settle to the bottom of the pan. Gold panning was slow even for the most skillful miner. On a good day, one miner could wash about 50 pans in the usual 12-hour workday.

`E` Another way was to use what was called a 'rocker'. Isaac Humphrey is said to have introduced it to the California gold fields. It was simply a rectangular wooden box, set at a downward angle and mounted on a rocking mechanism. The dirt and rock was dumped into the top, followed by a bucket of water. The box was rocked by hand to agitate the mixture. The big rocks were caught in a sieve at the top, the waste exited the lower end with the water, and the heavy gold fell to the bottom of the box.

The rocker had advantages and disadvantages. The advantages were that it was easily transportable; it did not require a constant source of water; and, most importantly, a miner could process more dirt and rock than with a pan. The primary disadvantage was that the rocker had difficulty in trapping the smallest particles of gold, commonly known as 'flour'. Some miners added small amounts of mercury to the bottom of the rocker. Due to its chemical composition, it had a facility to trap fine gold. Periodically, the miners would remove and heat it. As it vaporized, it would leave gold behind.

`F` After 1850, the surface gold in California had largely disappeared, even as miners continued to reach the gold fields. Mining had always been difficult and dangerous labor, and striking it rich required good luck as much as skill and hard work. Moreover, the average daily pay for an independent miner had by then dropped sharply from what it had been in 1848. As gold became more and more difficult to reach, the growing industrialization of mining drove more and more miners from independence into wage labor. The new technique of hydraulic mining, developed in 1853, brought enormous profits, but destroyed much of the region's landscape.

`G` Though gold mining continued throughout the 1850s, it had reached its peak by 1852, when gold worth some $81 million was pulled from the ground. After that year, the total take declined gradually, leveling off to around $45 million per year by 1857. Settlement in California continued, however, and by the end of the decade the state's population was 380,000.


# The development of the London underground railway 

In the first half of the 1800s, London’s population ***grew at an astonishing rate***, and the central area became increasingly congested. In addition, the expansion of the overground railway network resulted in more and more passengers arriving in the capital. However, in 1846, a Royal Commission decided that the railways should not be allowed to enter the City, the capital’s historic and business centre. The result was that the overground railway stations formed a ring around the City. The area within consisted of poorly built, overcrowded ***slums*** and the streets were full of horse-drawn traffic. Crossing the City became a nightmare. It could take an hour and a half to travel 8 km by horse-drawn carriage or bus. ***Numerous schemes were proposed to resolve these problems***, but few succeeded. 

***Amongst the most vocal advocates for a solution to London’s traffic problems*** was Charles Pearson, who worked as a ***solicitor*** for the City of London. He saw both social and economic advantages in building an underground railway that would link the overground railway stations together and clear London slums at the same time. His idea was to relocate the poor workers who lived in the inner-city slums to newly constructed suburbs, and to provide cheap rail travel for them to get to work. Pearson’s ideas ***gained support amongst*** some businessmen and in 1851 he submitted a plan to Parliament. It was rejected, but ***coincided with*** a proposal from another group for an underground connecting line, which Parliament passed.

The two groups merged and established the Metropolitan Railway Company in August 1854. The company’s plan was to construct an underground railway line from the Great Western Railway’s (GWR) station at Paddington to the edge of the City at Farringdon Street – a distance of almost 5 km. The organisation had difficulty in raising the funding for such a ***radical*** and expensive scheme, ***not least*** because of the critical articles printed by the press. ***Objectors*** argued that the tunnels would collapse under the weight of traffic overhead, buildings would be shaken and passengers would be poisoned by the emissions from the train engines. However, Pearson and his partners persisted. 

The GWR, aware that the new line would finally enable them to run trains into the heart of the City, invested almost £250,000 in the scheme. Eventually, ***over a five-year period***, £1m was raised. The chosen route ran beneath existing main roads to minimise the expense of Reading 17 demolishing buildings. Originally scheduled to be completed in 21 months, the construction of the underground line took three years. It was built just below street level using a technique known as ‘cut and cover’. A ***trench*** about ten metres wide and six metres deep was dug, and the sides temporarily held up with ***timber beams***. Brick walls were then constructed, and finally a brick arch was added to create a ***tunnel***. A two-metre-deep layer of soil was laid on top of the tunnel and the road above rebuilt. 

The Metropolitan line, which opened on 10 January 1863, was the world’s first underground railway. On its first day, almost 40,000 passengers were carried between Paddington and Farringdon, the journey taking about 18 minutes. By the end of the Metropolitan’s first year of operation, 9.5 million journeys had been made. 

Even as the Metropolitan ***began operation***, the first extensions to the line were being authorised; these were built over the next five years, reaching Moorgate in the east of London and Hammersmith in the west. The original plan was to pull the trains with steam ***locomotives***, using ***firebricks*** in the boilers to provide steam, but these engines were never introduced. Instead, the line used specially designed locomotives that were fitted with water tanks in which steam could be condensed. However, smoke and fumes remained a problem, even though ***ventilation shafts*** were added to the tunnels. 

Despite the extension of the underground railway, by the 1880s, congestion on London’s streets had become worse. The problem was partly that the existing underground lines formed a circuit around the centre of London and extended to the suburbs, but did not cross the capital’s centre. The ‘cut and cover’ method of construction was not an option in this part of the capital. The only alternative was to tunnel deep underground. 

Although the technology to create these tunnels existed, steam locomotives could not be used ***in such a confined space***. ***It wasn’t until*** the development of a reliable electric motor, and a means of transferring power from the generator to a moving train, that the world’s first deep-level electric railway, the City & South London, became possible. The line opened in 1890, and ran from the City to Stockwell, south of the River Thames. The trains were made up of three carriages and driven by electric engines. The carriages were narrow and had tiny windows just below the roof because ***it was thought that*** passengers would not want to ***look out at the tunnel walls***. The line was not without its problems, mainly caused by an unreliable power supply. Although the City & South London Railway was a great technical achievement, it did not make a profit. Then, in 1900, the Central London Railway, known as the ‘Tuppenny Tube’, began operation using new electric locomotives. It was very popular and soon afterwards new railways and extensions were added to the growing tube network. By 1907, the heart of today’s Underground system ***was in place***.

# Johnson's Dictionary
For the century before Johnson's Dictionary was published in 1775, there had been concern about the state of the English language. There was no standard way of speaking or writing and no agreement as to the best way of bringing some order to the chaos of English spelling. Dr Johnson provided the solution.

There had, of course, been dictionaries in the past, the first of these being a little book of some 120 pages, compiled by a certain Robert Cawdray, published in 1604 under the title A Table Alphabeticall 'of hard usuall English wordes'. Like the various dictionaries that came after it during the seventeenth century, Cawdray's tended to concentrate on 'scholarly' words; one function of the dictionary was to enable its student to convey an impression of fine learning.

***Beyond the practical need to*** make order out of chaos, the rise of dictionaries is associated with the rise of the English middle class, who were anxious to define and ***circumscribe*** the various worlds to conquer- ***lexical*** as well as social and commercial. It is highly appropriate that Dr Samuel Johnson, the very model of an eighteenth-century literary man, as famous in his own time as in ours, should have published his Dictionary at the very beginning of the ***heyday*** of the middle class.

Johnson was a poet and critic who raised common sense to the heights of genius. His approach to the problems that had worried writers throughout the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries was intensely practical. Up until his time, the task of producing a dictionary on such a large scale had seemed impossible without the establishment of an academy to make decisions about right and wrong usage. Johnson decided he did not need an academy to settle arguments about language; he would write a dictionary himself; and he would do it ***single-handed***. Johnson signed the contract for the Dictionary with the bookseller Robert Dosley at a breakfast held at the Golden Anchor Inn near Holborn Bar on 18 June 1764. He was to be paid ￡1,575 in instalments, and from this he took money to rent 17 Gough Square, in which he set up his 'dictionary workshop'.

James Boswell, his biographer, described the ***garret*** where Johnson worked as 'itted up like a counting house' with a long desk running down the middle at which the copying clerks would work standing up. Johnson himself ***was stationed on a rickety chair*** at an 'old crazy deal table' surrounded by a chaos of borrowed books. He was also helped by six assistants, two of whom died whilst the Dictionary was still in preparation.

The work was ***immense***; filling about eighty large notebooks (and ***without a library to hand***), Johnson wrote the definitions of over 40,000 words, and illustrated their many meanings with some 114,000 quotations drawn from English writing on every subject, from the Elizabethans to his own time. He did not expect to achieve complete originality. Working to a deadline, he had to ***draw on*** the best of all previous dictionaries, and to make his work one of heroic synthesis. In fact, it was very much more. Unlike his predecessors, Johnson treated English very practically, as a living language, with many different shades of meaning. He adopted his definitions ***on the principle of*** English common law-***according to precedent***. After its publication, his Dictionary ***was not seriously rivalled*** for over a century.

After many ***vicissitudes*** the Dictionary was finally published on 15 April 1775. It was instantly recognised as a ***landmark*** throughout Europe. 'This very noble work,' wrote the leading Italian lexicographer, 'will be ***a perpetual monument of Fame*** to the Author, an Honour to his own Country in particular, and a general Benefit to the republic of Letters throughout Europe.' The fact that Johnson had ***taken on*** the Academies of Europe and matched them (everyone knew that forty French academics had taken forty years to produce the first French national dictionary) ***was cause for*** much English celebration.

Johnson had worked for nine years, 'with little assistance of the learned, and without any ***patronage*** of the great; not in the soft ***obscurities*** of retirement, or under the shelter of academic ***bowers***, but ***amidst*** inconvenience and distraction, in sickness and in sorrow'. For all its faults and ***eccentricities*** his two-volume work is a masterpiece and a landmark in his own words, 'setting the ***orthography***, displaying the analogy, regulating the structures, and ***ascertaining the significations*** of English words'. It is the ***cornerstone*** of Standard English, an achievement which, in James Boswell's words, '***conferred stability on*** the language of his country'.

The Dictionary, together with his other writing, made Johnson famous and so well esteemed that his friends were able to ***prevail upon*** King George Ⅲ to offer him a pension. From then on, he was to become ***the Johnson of folklore***.


# Nature or Nurture?

A few years ago, in one of the most fascinating and disturbing experiments in behavioural psychology, Stanley Milgram of Yale University tested 40 subjects ***from all walks of life*** for their willingness to obey instructions given by a 'leader' in a situation in which the subjects might feel a personal **distaste** for the actions they were called upon to perform. Specifically, Milgram told each volunteer 'teacher-subject' that the experiment was ***in the noble cause of education***, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes would have a positive effect on the pupils' ability to learn.

Milgram's experimental set-up involved placing the teacher-subject before a panel of thirty switches with labels ranging from '15 volts of electricity (slight shock)' to '450 volts (danger - severe shock)' ***in steps of 15 volts each***. The teacher-subject was told that whenever the pupil gave the wrong answer to a question, ***a shock was to be administered***, beginning at the lowest level and increasing ***in severity*** with each successive wrong answer. The supposed 'pupil' was in reality an actor hired by Milgram to simulate receiving the shocks by emitting ***a spectrum of groans, screams and writhings*** together with ***an assortment of*** statements and ***expletives denouncing*** both the experiment and the experimenter. Milgram told the teacher-subject to ignore the reactions of the pupil, and to administer whatever level of shock was called for, as per the rule governing the experimental situation of the moment.

As the experiment ***unfolded***, the pupil would ***deliberately*** give the wrong answers to questions posed by the teacher, thereby bringing on various electrical punishments, even up to the danger level of 300 volts and beyond. Many of the teacher-subjects ***balked at*** administering the higher levels of punishment, and turned to Milgram with questioning looks and/or complaints about continuing the experiment. In these situations, Milgram calmly explained that the teacher-subject was to ignore the pupil's cries for mercy and ***carry on with*** the experiment. If the subject was still ***reluctant*** to proceed, Milgram said that it was important ***for the sake of*** the experiment that the procedure be followed through to the end. His final argument was, 'You have no other choice. You must go on.' What Milgram was trying to discover was the number of teacher-subjects who would be willing to administer the highest levels of shock, even in the face of ***strong personal and moral revulsion*** against the rules and conditions of the experiment.

***Prior to carrying out*** the experiment, Milgram explained his idea to a group of 39 psychiatrists and asked them to predict the average percentage of people ***in an ordinary population*** who would be willing to administer the highest shock level of 450 volts. The overwhelming ***consensus*** was that virtually all the teacher-subjects would refuse to obey the experimenter. The psychiatrists felt that 'most subjects would not go beyond 150 volts' and they further anticipated that only four per cent would go up to 300 volts. Furthermore, they thought that only a ***lunatic fringe*** of about one in 1,000 would give the highest shock of 450 volts.

What were the actual results? Well, over 60 per cent of the teacher-subjects continued to obey Milgram up to the 450-volt limit! ***In repetitions of*** the experiment in other countries, the percentage of ***obedient*** teacher-subjects was even higher, reaching 85 per cent in one country. How can we possibly account for this vast ***discrepancy*** between what calm, rational, knowledgeable people predict in the comfort of their study and what pressured, ***flustered***, but cooperative 'teachers' actually do in the laboratory of real life?

One's first ***inclination*** might be to argue that there must be some sort of built-in animal aggression instinct that was activated by the experiment, and that Milgram's teacher-subjects were just following a genetic need to ***discharge this pent-up primal urge onto*** the pupil by administering the electrical shock. A modern ***hard-core*** sociobiologist might even go so far as to claim that this aggressive instinct evolved as an ***advantageous trait***, having been of survival value to our ancestors in their struggle against the ***hardships of life*** on the plains and in the caves, ultimately finding its way into our genetic ***make-up*** as a ***remnant*** of our ancient animal ways.

An alternative to this notion of genetic programming is to see the teacher-subjects' actions as a result of the social environment under which the experiment was carried out. ***As Milgram himself pointed out***, 'Most subjects in the experiment see their behaviour in a larger context that is ***benevolent*** and useful to society - the pursuit of scientific truth. The psychological laboratory ***has a strong claim to legitimacy*** and evokes trust and confidence in those who perform there. An action such as shocking a victim, which ***in isolation appears evil***, ***acquires a completely different meaning*** when placed in this setting.'

Thus, in this explanation the subject merges his unique personality and personal and moral code with that of larger institutional structures, surrendering individual properties like loyalty, self-sacrifice and discipline to the service of ***malevolent*** systems of authority.

Here we have two radically different explanations for why so many teacher-subjects were willing to forgo their sense of personal responsibility for the sake of an institutional authority figure. The problem for biologists, psychologists and ***anthropologists*** is to ***sort out*** which of these two polar explanations is more ***plausible***. This, ***in essence***, is the problem of modern sociobiology - to discover the degree to which ***hard-wired*** genetic programming ***dictates***, or at least strongly biases, the interaction of animals and humans with their environment, that is, their behaviour. ***Put another way***, sociobiology ***is concerned with*** ***elucidating*** the biological basis of all behaviour.



# The Truth about the Environment
For many environmentalists, the world seems to be getting worse. They have developed a ***hit-list*** of our main fears: that natural resources are running out; that the population is ever growing, leaving less and less to eat; that species are becoming extinct in vast numbers, and that the planet's air and water are becoming ever more polluted.

But a quick look at the facts shows a different picture. First, energy and other natural resources have become more abundant, not less so, since the book 'The Limits to Growth' was published in 1972 by a group of scientists. Second, more food is now produced per head of the world's population than ***at any time in history***. Fewer people are starving. Third, although species are indeed becoming extinct, only about 0.7% of them are expected to disappear in the next 50 years, not 25-50%, as has so often been predicted. And finally, ***most forms of*** environmental pollution either appear to have been exaggerated, or are ***transient*** - associated with the ***early phases of industrialisation*** and therefore best cured not by restricting economic growth, but by accelerating it. One form of pollution - the release of greenhouse gases that causes global warming - does appear to be a phenomenon that is going to extend well into our future, but its total impact is unlikely to pose a devastating problem. A bigger problem may well turn out to be ***an inappropriate response to it***.

Yet ***opinion polls suggest that*** many people nurture the belief that environmental standards are declining and four factors seem to cause this ***disjunction between perception and reality***.

One is the ***lopsidedness*** ***built into*** scientific research. Scientific funding goes mainly to areas with many problems. That may be wise policy, but it will also create an impression that many more potential problems exist than is the case.

Secondly, environmental groups need to be noticed by the mass media. They also need to keep the money ***rolling in***. Understandably, perhaps, they sometimes overstate their arguments. In 1997, for example, the World Wide Fund for Nature issued a press release entitled: 'Two thirds of the world's forests lost forever'. The truth turns out to be nearer 20%.

Though these groups are run overwhelmingly by ***selfless*** folk, they nevertheless share many of the characteristics of other ***lobby*** groups. That would matter less if people applied the same degree of ***scepticism*** to environmental lobbying as they do to lobby groups in other fields. A trade organisation arguing for, say, weaker pollution controls is instantly seen as ***self-interested***. Yet a green organisation opposing such a weakening is seen as ***altruistic***, even if an ***impartial*** view of the controls in question might suggest they are doing more harm than good.

A third source of confusion is the attitude of the media. People are clearly more curious about bad news than good. Newspapers and broadcasters are there to provide what the public wants. That, however, can lead to significant ***distortions of perception***. An example was America's encounter with El Niño in 1997 and 1998. This climatic phenomenon was accused of ***wrecking*** tourism, causing allergies, melting the ski-slopes and causing 22 deaths. However, according to an article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, the damage it did was estimated at US $4 billion but the benefits amounted to some US $19 billion. These came from higher winter temperatures (which saved an estimated 850 lives, reduced heating costs and diminished spring floods caused by meltwaters).

The fourth factor is poor individual perception. People worry that the endless rise in the amount of stuff everyone throws away will cause the world to run out of places to dispose of waste. Yet, even if America's trash output continues to rise as it has done in the past, and even if the American population doubles by 2100, all the rubbish America produces through the entire 21st century will still take up only one-12,000th of the area of the entire United States.

So what of global warming? As we know, carbon dioxide emissions are causing the planet to warm. The best estimates are that the temperatures will rise by 2-3℃ in this century, causing considerable problems, at a total cost of US $5,000 billion.

Despite the intuition that something ***drastic*** needs to be done about such a costly problem, economic analyses clearly show it will be far more expensive to cut carbon dioxide emissions ***radically*** than to pay the costs of adaptation to the increased temperatures. A model by one of the main authors of the United Nations Climate Change Panel shows how an expected temperature increase of 2.1 degrees in 2100 would only be diminished to an increase of 1.9 degrees. Or to put it another way, the temperature increase that the planet would have experienced in 2094 would ***be postponed to*** 2100.

So this does not prevent global warming, but merely buys the world six years. Yet the cost of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, for the United States alone, will be higher than the cost of solving the world's single, most pressing health problem: providing universal access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Such measures would avoid 2 million deaths every year, and prevent half a billion people from becoming seriously ill.

It is ***crucial*** that we look at the facts if we want to make the best possible decisions for the future. It may be costly to be overly optimistic - but more costly still to be too pessimistic.
